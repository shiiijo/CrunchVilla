Tailwind Css
- Css on the go (in the same files)
- reusability
- less bundle size(makes app faster)
- flexible UI (we can customize acc to our need) - it is not allowed in material UI

- tailwind css is library is installed with one more library it is postCss
- postCss converts class names of tailwind css to normal css which is unnderstandable by browser
- 'npx tailwindCss init' command will initialize our project to use tailwindCss
- above will create config file , in which we need to do tail wind configuration
- uses of tailwind
 - no duplication of css
 - easy to debug
 - code is less and easy to use
 - bundle size is small

- cons
 - it needs a decent learning before using
 - code grows horizontally because of many class names and reduces readbility
